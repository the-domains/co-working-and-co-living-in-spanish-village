In
Finca Los Motivos we create a home for location independent
entrepreneurs to relax and enjoy nature and a good climate, while
working on their business.

Are
you tired and sick of living in a hectic city environment ? Working
on your own from your flat ? Getting stressed by traffic jams, lining
up in the supermarkets ? Hating the bad weather and getting sad all
the time ? Do you feel that you cannot breathe and you are trapped ?
You want to move on and do it fast ? Getting out of your studio, your flat, your asphalt
environment ? And wanting to see more of the world, being able to walk in the garden, first thing in the morning and see how the sun is rising behind the mountains ?
Enjoying splendid, bright full moon nights or being amazed about the
amount of stars in the sky ? Breathe the full pure air ?  

Are you a digital entrepreneur, a
startup, a coach, a trainer, a digital nomad and you want to work on
your business from a beautiful location in Spain ? Then Finca Los
Motivos might just be the answer for you. For a limited community of
dedicated entrepreneurs, we offer a comfortable room with all the
basics, a splendid garden with a big swimming pool, bbq area, sol y
sombra area's, a nice community house with dining and living room,
library, kitchen, loads of parking space, loads of nature and
quietness to work on your business. There is also a small conference
room and a massage room available. Rental is from 1 month up to 3 or
6 or more ....

Or as
long as you enjoy it....
